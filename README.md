Unclear or evolving requirements

Frequent customer collaboration

Fast-paced development needs

High complexity and innovation


✅ Examples of Agile-friendly Projects

1. Software Development & Startups – A tech startup building a new app benefits from Agile because they can quickly adapt to user feedback and market trends.


2. Game Development – New features and mechanics can be tested and refined iterativel
## When Waterfall is More Beneficial

Waterfall works best when:

Requirements are well-defined upfront

Strict regulations must be followed

Changes are costly or difficult to implement

Documentation and traceability are essential


✅ Examples of Waterfall-friendly Projects

1. Construction & Engineering – A bridge or skyscraper project requires clear planning, approvals, and strict sequencing.


2. Government & Defense Projects – Compliance and security regulations require extensive documentation and structured processes.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
## Implement a Strong Testing Strategy

Different types of testing ensure that software functions correctly under various conditions.

Unit Testing – Tests individual components or functions of the software.

Integration Testing – Ensures different modules work together as expected.

System Testing – Verifies the entire application against requirements.

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) – Ensures the software meets business needs before deployment.

Performance Testing – Checks how the system performs under load.

Security Testing – Identifies vulnerabilities and ensures data protection.



2. Adopt Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Automated Testing – Running tests automatically after code changes to catch issues early.

Frequent Builds & Deployments – Ensures stability and quick bug fixes.

Version Control (e.g., Git) – Helps track changes and prevent conflicts.



3. Use Code Reviews & Pair Programming

Code Reviews – Developers review each other's code for errors, readability, and best practices.

Pair Programming – Two developers work together to write and review code in real-time.
## Why High Standards Matter

1. Improves User Satisfaction – Buggy or slow software leads to frustration and loss of trust.


2. Reduces Maintenance Costs – Fixing defects early is far cheaper than post-release.


3. Enhances Security – Prevents data breaches and compliance violations.


4. Ensures Scalability – High-quality code is easier to maintain and extend.


## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
## Defining the project scope is crucial because it establishes the boundaries, objectives, deliverables, and constraints of a project. A well-defined scope helps in:

1. Preventing Scope Creep – Clearly outlines what is included and excluded, avoiding uncontrolled changes.


2. Setting Clear Expectations – Ensures all stakeholders understand project goals and deliverables.


3. Improving Resource Allocation – Helps allocate time, budget, and personnel efficiently.
##What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)?

A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of a project into smaller, manageable components. It visually breaks down the entire scope into tasks, making project execution more organized.

Why is WBS Useful?

1. Improves Project Planning & Scheduling – Breaks complex projects into structured tasks for better tracking.


2. Enhances Accountability – Assigns responsibility for each component to specific team members.
